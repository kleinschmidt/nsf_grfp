* presented at conferences/workshops
* begun to extend model of adaptation in controlled laboratory experiments to more relevant scenarios like encountering multiple speakers in everyday life
* applied same modeling principles to language processing at other levels (syntactic expectations)
* pursued further training in statistics and methods, and shared expertise and tools for reproducible and shareable science with academic community here.
* prepared for, wrote, and passed qualifying exams. 

My work focuses on developing rigorous, quantitative models of how people deal with the different ways that different people pronounce speech sounds.  This work started in the previous tenure year focusing on very simple laboratory experiments where a wealth of specific data is available, and I have recently been refining and extending that early work while authoring a paper on it for journal publication.  I have also been exploring the implications of that work for a theory of how people deal with such variability in pronunciations in general, when encountering different people in their everyday language experience.  This work is ongoing but has already yielded some theoretical insights, which I communicated in a poster presentation at the inaugural meeting of a workshop specifically focusing on speech adaptation (the CIMSA workshop at OSU).

I have also explored how the modeling framework that I developed to account for speech perception might extend to other levels of linguistic processing.  In collaboration with Alex Fine, another graduate student at the University of Rochester, I developed a model of syntactic expectation adaptation in a self-paced reading study that he conducted, which I presented at the meeting of the Cognitive Science Society in Japan.

In the past year, I have pursued further study in quantitative methods for data analysis and computational modeling, including further training in statistics, and have shared expertise and tools for reproducible and shareable science with the academic community here.  Most notably, in the past year I prepared for, wrote, and successfully passed my qualifying exams.  I also presented two talks at an international conference (the meeting of the Cognitive Science Society) and presented a poster.

Finally, I have increased the broader impacts of my work not only through usual channels of presentations and publications, but also by participation as an author for the Human Language Processing Lab blog (which I am a member of).  I have also created a self-contained library for running speech perception experiments on the internet via Amazon's Mechanical Turk service.  My software is publicly available on the internet under the open-source GNU Lesser General Public License.  I hope that by sharing the results of my efforts to develop a web-based experimental platform I might increase the diversity of the populations which can participate in psychology research and lower the boundary of entry for researchers in behavioral research.  To date, I have been contacted personally by two other groups which have adapted the software for their own studies.
